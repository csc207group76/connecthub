## Equitable Use

**Users can contribute to discussions regardless of technical expertise by using a simple post system.** Posts can be deleted if they are harmful to any type of user, but this functionality could be made better by having moderators. The design makes use of various shades of blue (monochromatic design) and avoids red and green, to be inclusive of users who may be colorblind.

## Flexibility in Use

**Unfortunately, our app does not allow for users to switch to screen readers for visually impaired users or to a different language for users whose preferred language is not English.**

---

## Simple and Intuitive Use

**The navigation page is very clearly labeled and organized, which makes it easy for first-time users to use the app.** Error messages are detailed and simple to understand so that users can quickly fix their errors and are less likely to abandon the task.

---

## Low Physical Effort

**Frequent actions like posting and deleting are one-tap or one-click operations.** Infinite scrolling is implemented to view posts, which reduces repetitive clicks. Moreover, use of this app allows users to maintain a neutral body position and minimizes sustained physical effort. 
As well as, ConnectHub would also reduce the need for users to meet up in person to have discussions that they could instead host on the app.

## Perceptible Information

**Adequate contrast between buttons and surroundings.** All buttons have fonts and sizes that are large and clear enough to be legible. Our app could be improved by making use of icons for more clarity and a notification system to communicate important information.

---

## Tolerance for Error

**The app is forgiving of mistakes.** Posts can be deleted, and users are prompted with confirmation dialogs for major actions. Additionally, all entry fields are updated in real-time to ensure ease when users are deciding on the post they are creating or entering personal details when they sign up.

## Size and Space for Approach and Use

**Buttons and links are large and well-spaced, preventing accidental clicks.** The layout adapts to screen sizes, whether on mobile or desktop.

---

## Target Audience

**If we were to license our program, the primary target audience would be young adults since they are very likely to have high digital literacy.** They are likely to turn to such platforms to contribute to niche communities they identify with. 
We would specifically cater to educational institutions or community groups who are looking for an online space to host discussions.
Students could use it for class discussions while community groups can use it for exchanging ideas or setting up events.

## Excluded Groups

**While the program is designed to be accessible for most, there are groups that may be excluded by our application.** For example, users without reliable internet access or modern devices could struggle to make use of the app. Additionally, those who struggle with digital literacy (e.g., the elderly) could find it daunting to use initially. Similarly, since our forum does not have a text-to-speech functionality, it also would exclude users who are visually impaired. Ignoring these groups can cause relational harm by making users feel excluded or undervalued compared to others. Hence, these gaps would serve as first steps to help make the app more inclusive when further developed.
