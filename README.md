This project is a hybrid of a Swing app and a React app with SpringBoot as the backend. You can choose to run either versions of the app.


## Features
- [x] Create posts online

Roadmap for future:
* Interactions with posts such as comments or favourite them.

Note that post filtering and deletion features is not available on the web version.

## Getting Started
***
If you want to use the web version, you don't need to install anything - you can navigate here to get started: https://connecthub-i5rz.onrender.com/

Note that it may take a while for the website to load - the server shuts down after periods of inactivity and needs to restart.

Because this is a hybrid of a web and a swing app, and since the swing app was designed to be used locally by one person, the server will only keep track of the newest person that has logged into the program.

***Warning:*** the current webite is a beta version and does not have a secure authentication. Do not use any personal information.

### Executing the program

#### Running the Swing App
- In your favourite IDE, load the `pom.xml` file by right clicking on it
- Navigate to `src/main/java/app/ConnectHub.java` in the source code and execute the script
- A sign up or login window will pop up, you can start using the app
- To exit the app, simply close the window

#### Running the Web App
- Open up a terminal and run the following commands
```
$ npm install       # install front end dependencies
$ npm run watch     # builds and updates static assets, keep this running
```
- Open up another terminal and run the following commands
```
$ mvn install                # install back end dependencies and packages app
$ java -jar target/*.jar     # starts the backend server
```

#### Running the Web App with Docker
If you are using Docker, you won't need to install anything else mentioned previously. We will use Docker desktop.

- Run the command:
```
# create a docker image
$ docker build -t <your-image-name> .
```
- In Docker desktop, find the image with the tag name you built and run it - in the modal that pops up:
    * Set port to `8080`
    * Set the enviornmnet variables from your .env file
- Navigate to `https://localhost:8080/signup` or `https://localhost:8080`
- To exit the program, you can stop the container by
    * Going to `images`
    * Locate the image that you ran
    * In `Actions`, click on "Show image actions" -> "View container usage"
    * Stop the container -->


## Usage
After you successfully ran the application (either swing or web), you can either sign up or log in. Once in the home page, you can see a list of posts that are posted by others. Click on them to see the posts individually.

You can also find a button to create post. The new post created will be updated in the home page. Additionally on the home page, you can filter posts by clicking on the topics on the left.
